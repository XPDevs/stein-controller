This api is quite buggy:

when pressed to go left the character will eep walking forever

to do:

fix that the player doesnt keep walking even when the user has not pressed any buttons
add more controlls 
add settings in either the premade settings screen or sepreate settings menu
add the option to switch between controller and mouse, keybourd

settings:

button remaping
deadzone configuration
controller vibration feedback (if supported)
quick hotbar access
